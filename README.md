“Pick n Chop” as the name implies is a waste disposal platform that rewards users 
for picking and disposing of plastic wastes in designated regions. It is built on 
the blockchain to provide transparency and accountability of assets in the platform 
for users to access as rewards will be given in the proportion of plastic wastes 
they dispose of. It will also create an alternative source of income for users who 
put extra effort into disposing of a larger quantity of plastic wastes as they will
be eligible for higher rewards and this process will scale-up waste management and 
environmental sustainability practice.
